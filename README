This is the version of the code that runs on my personal BookWyrm
instance, https://libros.rizoma1.ar.

I keep open pull requests for the stuff I’m working on (though not
all of them are meant for upstream.)

Reported issues here are just reminders for small things I want to
take care of, or ideas. In general, it’s stuff that doesn’t merit
a bug report against the main repo.
